## Entry-Level Luxury Car Market Analysis

#### Project Overview
This project analyzes social media discussions from **Edmunds.com** to help the hypothetical JD Power & Associates understand the competitive landscape of entry-level luxury cars in the USA. Using **web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and statistical modeling,** we extract key insights about brand mentions, associations, and customer preferences

#### Tech Stack & Tools
- Programming Language: Python 
- Libraries Used:
- Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Requests
- Data Processing: pandas, numpy, re
- NLP: NLTK, spaCy
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Statistical Analysis: scipy, statsmodels

#### Project Tasks
##### Data Collection & Processing
- Web Scraping – Extract 5,000 posts from Edmunds Entry-Level Luxury Forum
- Text Cleaning & Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization

##### Analysis & Insights
- Task A: Validate Zipf’s Law on car discussion data using word frequency analysis
- Task B: Identify top 10 most-mentioned brands using frequency counts
- Task C: Compute lift ratios to determine brand associations
- Task D: Generate a Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) Map for visualizing brand similarities
- Task E: Business insights from brand associations & competitive landscape
- Task F: Extract top 5 most-discussed car features and their associated brands
- Task G: Business recommendations based on consumer preferences
- Task H: Determine the most aspirational luxury brand using sentiment & context analysis

## Crowdsourced Beer Recommender System

#### Project Overview
This project builds the foundation for a crowdsourced recommender system that suggests craft beers based on user-specified attributes. Using text analytics, cosine similarity, sentiment analysis, and word embeddings, we analyze beer reviews from BeerAdvocate.com to provide personalized recommendations.

#### Tech Stack & Tools
- Programming Language: Python 
- Libraries Used:
- Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Requests
- Data Processing: pandas, numpy, re
- Text Analysis: NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn
- Sentiment Analysis: VADER, TextBlob, LLMs
- Similarity & Recommender Models: TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Word Embeddings
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

#### Project Tasks
##### Data Collection & Processing
- Web Scraping – Extracted 5,000+ beer reviews from BeerAdvocate
- Text Cleaning & Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, normalization

##### Analysis & Recommendation System
- Task A: Extract and preprocess beer reviews (~1,700-2,000 with meaningful text)
- Task B: Identify top beer attributes through frequency and lift analysis
- Task C: Compute cosine similarity scores between customer-specified attributes and reviews
- Task D: Perform sentiment analysis using VADER (or LLM-based sentiment models)
- Task E: Develop evaluation scores for ranking beers and generate top 3 recommendations
- Task F: Compare Bag-of-Words vs. Word Embeddings in recommendation accuracy
- Task G: Analyze how top-rated beers differ from attribute-based recommendations
- Task H: Find the most similar beer for a given beer among a sample set of 10
